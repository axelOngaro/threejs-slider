# Introduction

This is the a quick starter project I made and use to quickly experiment stuffs with three js. You can also start a project from scratch.

# Installation

```
npm install
npm run start
```

And then go to `localhost:1234`

# Structure

All the code you're editing is in the src folder.

All the images, videos, svg, fonts go in the assets folder.

shaders folder contains two blank fragment.glsl and vertex.glsl files.

I'll add more methods to the threeJs part in the app.js file.
